			<h3>Sowseeds International Ministries accepts the Bible as the inspired and revealed word of God and adopts these statements as fundamental truths and doctrine:</h3>
			<br>
			<h3>Trinity</h3>
			<p>We believe in one, triune God revealed as the Father, Jesus Christ the Son and Holy Spirit. All are co-equal and co-eternal. - Matthew 28:20</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Jesus is the Son of God</h3>
			<p>We believe in Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God who became a man anointed by the Holy Spirit to redeem mankind. He was crucified and buried, then resurrected from the dead. He ascended into Heaven and is now seated at the right hand of God the Father. - Luke 4:18; Mark 16:19</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Salvation is for Everyone</h3>
			<p>We believe all men have sinned and are in need of salvation, which has been provided through the shed blood of Jesus Christ. Salvation is a gift from God that can only be obtained by repentance from one's own dead works and by faith towards God. - Romans 3:23</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Water Baptism</h3>
			<p>We believe in the Lord's ordinance of Water Baptism as a confirmation of the believer's salvation experience in Christ and communion as a remembrance and celebration of the Lord's death.<br>
			- Romans 6:3-4; 1Peter 3:21</p>

			<h3>Holy Spirit</h3>
			<p>We believe in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit in accordance to the command of our Lord Jesus Christ for the empowerment of Christian service, the bestowal of gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry. This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the experience of salvation and is evidenced by the speaking with other tongues. - Matthew 28:19</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Great Commission</h3>
			<p>We believe in the Great Commission to preach the Gospel in all the world and the laying on of hands to heal the sick and deliver the oppressed. - Matthew 9:35; Mark 16:17-18</p>
			<br>
			<h3>God is Good</h3>
			<p>We believe in the goodness of God, who redeems men from sin, sickness and disease, and poverty and tragedy. Believers are made righteous by the blood of Christ and have the promise of divine healing, health and long life. Abundance and success in every area of life have also been provided for by Christ's work on the cross. - Colossians 13; 1 Peter 2:24</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Marriage</h3>
			<p>We believe in the institution of marriage. Strong marriages make strong families, strong families make for strong churches, communities and ultimately a strong nation. Marriage is a divine covenant between a man and a woman from which children are nurtured and trained to become leaders of the next generation. Strong families are the building block of our society, the hope for future generations. We believe in passing on a legacy of faith to our children by a thorough grounding of Godâ€™s Word.<br>
			- Genesis 2:24; Ephesians 5:22-33; Deuteronomy 6:4-7; Ephesians 6:1-4</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Return of the Lord</h3>
			<p>We believe in the visible and imminent return of the Lord Jesus, His millennial reign on the earth, and the resurrection of the saved to everlasting life and the lost to eternal damnation. - 1 John 3:1-3; Revelations 20:11,12</p>
